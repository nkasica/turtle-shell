# turtle-shell
turtle is a UNIX shell, written entirely in C. Also, the code for this program is C89 Standard compliant!

## Getting Started
### Depenancies
To write turtle, I used [MobaXTerm](https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/). However, any platform that allows you to run Linux/UNIX based commands should be okay!

## Compilation
Type `make` to create an executable named `turtle`. Then type `turtle` into your shell and the program will run!
To remove the executable, type `make clean`

## Usage
While turtle is not as complex as many other shells, it can still execute most commands you normally would run. 
Some built-in shell commands include:
* exit/quit
* cd
* pushd
* dirs
* popd
* help

## Notes
I plan on continually adding more functionality to turtle soon. Here is a todo-list:
* Globbing (Wildcards)
* Piping
* Input/Output redirection
* More built-ins
